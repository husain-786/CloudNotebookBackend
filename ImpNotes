Hacker had already table called "Rainbow Table" which consist password and it's hashCode..., there might a 
billion or trillion of table in the Rainbow table and there is possiblities that one hashCode might match with the 
actual password hash. 

SALT:-
    SO for the secuirity purpose a concept caleled "SALT" is used with the password, it's a random string e.g., a12de34@e 
    that is being added with the actual password and then hash get created and that bacame more secure. And for a hacker 
    it's almost impossible to hack, because for hacker creating "Rainbow Table" for "PASSWORD+SALT" is almost impossible.

    "bcryptjs" package is used for same with function "genSalt"

PEPPER:-
    "PEPPER" is also a fixed string that gets added with the password and salt and make more stronger hash.
    "PASSWORD+SALT+PEPPER"
